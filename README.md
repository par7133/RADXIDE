# RADXIDE

<br>
Envisioned for RAD development in PHP..
<br><br>
RADXIDE checks for the existance of the Working Dir
in /home/YourUser/.radxwork.

The "Code Library" of the window right pane needs the 
folder $dan(WORKDIR)/.snippets eg:<br> 
<br> 
/home/YourUser/.radxwork/.snippets<br><br>
and must be filled in with your example files tagged with 
one [tag] on their names and containg a first line of 
#comment to give a the menu a descriptive nomenclature:<br>
<br>
~/.radxwork/.snippets/file [php].inc:<br>
#Example of PHP code<br>
phpinfo();<br>
<br>
Please see "examples/_snippets"
<br><br>
RADXIDE enforces the following Project structure:<br>
/Private<br>
/Public<br>
<br>
Setting dan(MAXFILES) you define how many files max the
project can contain. Setting dan(MAXFILESIZE) you define the 
max size of the file RADXIDE can handle.  The defaults are some good ones, but in the need you know what to change.
<br><br>
You can exclude folders from the project by adding 
their name to $dan(prjdirignore) 
eg {.git nbproject} in a way they are ignored by RADXIDE.<br> 
NB: files and folders in the root of the project are ignored by default.
You can always hide any file or folder by the subfix " y".
